# A sloppy and unscientific ordering of emoji for learning vocabulary

The list can be found [here](levels.json).

The type of the JSON object in the file is `string[][]`: an ordered list of sets of emoji, from most common to least. 

Currently there are only 4 levels with (150 or 200) emojis each.
